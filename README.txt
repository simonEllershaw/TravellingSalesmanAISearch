Travelling Salesman

Optimised AI search algorithms are implemented within geneticAlgorithm.py
and simAnnealing.py. For a full account of the implementation and extensive
optimisation process please see the pdf report.

They both take each city info from the cityfiles folder (the format of the input
data can be seen within these files).

The tours found where then outputted to their respective folders

This can be rerun by running the relevant python file but please note the runtime
may be significant (numpy is required).

The validity of the tours can be proved using validtourcheck.py
